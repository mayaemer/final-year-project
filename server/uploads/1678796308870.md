For the data manipulation I decided to filter the data where total global sales are greater than 300, resulting in the top 7 video game publishers, to reduce the
amount of data being displayed, making my graphs clearer and more focused to a point.

For respresenting a single publisher, I felt that all the graphs clearly displayed the data.

For representing the all of the publishers (that had been filtered) I did not feel that the stacked line chart was very effective as so many of the lines crossed
over each other, making the data not very clear to the viewer. I felt the stacked bar chart and area chart, while looking the most appealing, are a bit more 
difficult to understand what is actually being represented in the data, like in the stacked bar chart what is the amount of gross sales being represented in each
bar? It is not very clear to understand. The scatter chart similarly to the stacked line chart results in multiple overlaps, again making it more difficult for the 
viewer. 

I found the small multiple charts to be the most effective as it allows the viewer to see the global sales of each publisher in isolation, allowing the user to 
grasp the global sales of each publisher individually, but also comparitively as they are displayed directly above and under each other.
