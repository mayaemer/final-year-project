- mongo db 
- when it says re order stages - does this just mean reorder by adding an index
and discussing the changes in the stages ?
- should the docker commands to create the clusters be in the cql/ sql files?

for the mongo db aggregation pipeline, when you mention reordering stages - is this just from the indexing, which causes the stages to change in the execution plan which we discuss?

Yes - based on how you think the indexes would improve the stages

No there is no need to include the docker code as long as you have output to show that they are running
